        <h2 id="heading">Social Media Impacts</h2>
        Social media allows teens to create online identities, communicate with others and build social networks. These
        networks can provide teens with valuable support, especially helping those who experience exclusion or have
        disabilities or chronic illnesses.
        ` Teens also use social media for entertainment and self-expression. And the platforms can expose teens to
        current events, allow them to interact across geographic barriers and teach them about a variety of subjects,
        including healthy behaviors. Social media that's humorous or distracting or provides a meaningful connection to
        peers and a wide social network might even help teens avoid depression.

            However, social media use can also negatively affect teens, distracting them, disrupting their sleep, and
            exposing them to bullying, rumor spreading, unrealistic views of other people's lives and peer pressure.
            The risks might be related to how much social media teens use. A 2019 study of more than 6,500 12- to
            15-year-olds in the U.S. found that those who spent more than three hours a day using
            social media might be at heightened risk for mental health problems. Another 2019 study of more than 12,000
            13- to 16-year-olds in England found that using social media more than three times a day predicted poor
            mental health and well-being in teens.
            Other studies also have observed links between high levels of social media use and depression or anxiety
            symptoms. A 2016 study of more than 450 teens found that greater social media use, nighttime social media
            use and emotional investment in social media — such as feeling upset when prevented from logging on — were
            each linked
            with worse sleep quality and higher levels of anxiety and depression.

            There are steps you can take to encourage responsible use of social media and limit some of its negative effects. Consider these tips:
Set reasonable limits. Talk to your teen about how to avoid letting social media interfere with his or her activities, sleep, meals or homework. Encourage a bedtime routine that avoids electronic media use, and keep cellphones and tablets out of teens' bedrooms. Set an example by following these rules yourself.
Monitor your teen's accounts. Let your teen know that you'll be regularly checking his or her social media accounts. You might aim to do so once a week or more. Make sure you follow through.
Explain what's not OK. Discourage your teen from gossiping, spreading rumors, bullying or damaging someone's reputation — online or otherwise. Talk to your teen about what is appropriate and safe to share on social media.
Encourage face-to-face contact with friends. This is particularly important for teens vulnerable to social anxiety disorder.
Talk about social media. Talk about your own social media habits. Ask your teen how he or she is using social media and how it makes him or her feel. Remind your teen that social media is full of unrealistic images.
